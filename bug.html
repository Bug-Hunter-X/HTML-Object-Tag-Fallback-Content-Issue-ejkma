<p>This HTML snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the use of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag and MIME type handling:</p> <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;object data="data.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="800" height="600">&lt;p>Your browser doesn't support embedded PDFs.&lt;/p>&lt;/object></code></pre><p>The issue is that if the browser doesn't recognize the MIME type or the file type isn't properly served by the server, the fallback content (&lt;p>Your browser doesn't support embedded PDFs.&lt;/p>) might not be displayed.  The browser may simply show a blank space or a broken image icon instead.</p>
